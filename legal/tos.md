# Terms of Service — Unfiltered UK

**Last Updated:** April 2025  
**Effective Immediately**

## 1. Platform Model
Unfiltered UK is a decentralised communication platform. Each community ("server") operates its own isolated MongoDB database. **We do not host, access, or control server data** — including messages, roles, or media — unless required by law.

## 2. Your Responsibilities
- You are solely responsible for content in servers you own.
- Do not create servers to distribute illegal, harmful, or non-consensual material.
- Server owners assume full liability for their community's actions.

## 3. Data Ownership
- **Global data** (auth, DMs, subscriptions) is stored by Unfiltered UK.
- **Server data** resides in your server’s database. We cannot delete or recover it.
- DM archives (if enabled) are stored in user-consented databases.

## 4. Message Integrity
All messages are encrypted with a per-server AES-256 key and digitally signed by the platform. Tampering invalidates the signature and displays a warning.

## 5. Termination
We may suspend your account or block access to the platform for:
- Violating these terms
- Operating malicious servers
- Abusing the API or infrastructure

## 6. No Warranty
The platform is provided "as is". We disclaim all warranties, express or implied.

By using Unfiltered UK, you acknowledge that **you trust each server you join** — we are not responsible for their conduct.
